Internals tutorial
==================
Getting familiar with ``switchio``'s guts means learning to put the
appropriate components together to generate a call. This simple guide is
meant to provide some commentary surrounding low level components and
interfaces so that you can begin reading the source code.
It is assumed you are already familiar with the prerequisite
:doc:`deployment steps <fsconfig>`.


Primary Components
------------------
Currently there are 3 main objects in ``switchio`` for driving
*FreeSWITCH*:

:py:class:`~switchio.connection.Connection` - a thread safe wrapper around the
`ESL SWIG python package`_'s `ESLConnection`

:py:class:`~switchio.handlers.EventListener` - the type that contains the core
event processing loop and logic
    - Primarily concerned with observing and tracking the state of a single
      *FreeSWITCH* process
    - Normally a one-to-one pairing of listeners to slave processes/servers
      is recommended to ensure deterministic control.
    - Contains a :py:class:`~switchio.connection.Connection` used mostly for receiving
      events only transmitting ESL commands when dictated by :doc:```switchio`` apps <apps>`

:py:class:`~switchio.api.Client` - a client for controlling *FreeSWITCH* using the ESL inbound method
    - contains a :py:class:`~switchio.connection.Connection` for direct synchronous commands and
      optionally an :py:class:`~switchio.handlers.EventListener` for processing asynchronous calls

For this guide we will focus mostly on the latter two since they are the
primary higher level components the rest of the library builds upon.


Using a `Client` and `EventListener` pair
-----------------------------------------
A Client can be used for invoking or sending **synchronous** commands to the
*FreeSWITCH* process. It handles ESL `api` calls entirely on it's own.

To connect simply pass the hostname or ip address of the slave server at
instantiation::

    >>> from switchio import Client
    >>> client = Client('vm-host')
    >>> client.connect()  # could have passed the hostname here as well
    >>> client.api('status')  # call ESL `api` command directly
    <ESL.ESLevent; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'ESLevent *' at 0x28c1d10> >

    >>> client.cmd('global_getvar local_ip_v4')  # `api` wrapper which returns event body content
    '10.10.8.21'

    >>> client.cmd('not a real command')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        File "switchio/api.py", line 1093, in cmd
           return self.api(cmd).getBody().strip()
        File "switchio/handlers.py", line 1084, in api
           consumed, response = EventListener._handle_socket_data(event)
        File "switchio/api.py", line 651, in _handle_socket_data
           raise APIError(body)
    switchio.utils.APIError: -ERR not Command not found!

Now let's initiate a call originating from the slave process's
*caller* which is by default the `external`_ sip profile::

    >>> client.originate(dest_url='9196@intermediary_hostname:5060')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        File "switchio/api.py", line 1177, in originate
            listener = self._assert_alive(listener)
        File "switchio/api.py", line 1115, in _assert_alive
            assert self.listener, "No listener associated with this client"
        File "switchio/api.py", line 973, in get_listener
            "No listener has been assigned for this client")
        AttributeError: No listener has been assigned for this client

The `Client` implements `originate` by making an **asynchronous** ESL
`bgapi` call to the slave process. In order to track the eventual
results of that call, an `EventListener` must be used which will
collect the state changes triggered by the command (i.e. as received in
event data from the slave process).

With this current architecture you can think of a *listener* as an object
from which you can track *FreeSWITCH* state and a *client* as an interface
which drives the slave process using commands to trigger **new** state(s).
Again, any time a `Client` makes an **asynchronous** call an `EventListener` is
needed to handle and report back the result(s).

Let's create and assign an :py:class:`~switchio.handlers.EventListener`::

    >>> from switchio import get_listener
    >>> l = get_listener('vm-host')
    >>> l  # initially disconnected to allow for unsubcriptions from the default event set
    <EventListener [disconnected]>
    >>> l.connect()
    Feb 25 10:33:05 [INFO] switchio.EventListener@vm-host api.py:346 : Connected listener 'd2d4ee82-bd02-11e4-8b48-74d02bc595d7' to 'vm-host'
    >>> l
    <EventListener [connected]>
    >>> l.start()
    Feb 25 10:35:30 [INFO] switchio.EventListener@vm-host api.py:287 : starting event loop thread
    >>> client.listener = l

.. note::
    Alternatively an `EventListener` can be passed to the `Client` at
    instantiation time.


Now let's attempt our `originate` once more this time executing the *9197*
extension once the *caller* is answered, and calling the `echo` extension,
*9196*, at the *callee* end::

    >>> client.originate('9196@vm-host:5080',
        dp_exten=9197,
        proxy='intermediary_hostname:5060'
    )
    <switchio.models.Job at 0x7feea01c6c90>

    >>> client.listener.calls  # check the active calls collection
    OrderedDict([('72451178-bd0c-11e4-9d26-74d02bc595d7', <Call(72451178-bd0c-11e4-9d26-74d02bc595d7, 2 sessions)>)])

.. note::
    See the *default* dialplan packaged with stock *FreeSWITCH*.
    Use of these extensions assumes you have assigned the `external`_ sip
    profile to use the *default* dialplan by assigning it's *context* parameter


The async `originate` call returns to us a :py:class:`switchio.models.Job`
instance (as would any call to :py:meth:`switchio.api.Client.bgapi`).
A `Job` provides the same interface as that of the
:py:class:`multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult` and can be handled to
completion synchronously::

    >>> job = client.originate('9196@vm-host:5080',
        dp_exten=9197,
        proxy='intermediary_hostname:5060
    )
    >>> job.get(timeout=30)  # block up to 30 seconds waiting for result
    '4d9b4128-bd0f-11e4-9d26-74d02bc595d7'  # the originated session uuid

    >>> job.sess_uuid   # a special attr which is always reserved for originate results (i.e. session ids)
    '4d9b4128-bd0f-11e4-9d26-74d02bc595d7'

    >>> client.hupall()  # hangup the call


Call control using ``switchio`` apps
------------------------------------
To use ``switchio`` at its fullest potential, :doc:`applications <apps>` can be
written to process state tracked by the `EventListener`. The main
benefit is that apps can be written in pure Python somewhat like the
`mod_python <https://freeswitch.org/confluence/display/FREESWITCH/mod_python>`_
module provided with *FreeSWITCH*. ``switchio`` gives the added benefit that
the Python process does not have to run on the slave machine and in fact
**multiple** applications can be managed independently of **multiple**
slave configurations thanks to ``switchio``'s use of the ESL `inbound`_ method.


.. _appload:

App Loading
***********
``switchio`` apps are loaded using :py:meth:`switchio.api.Client.load_app`.
Each app is referenced by it's appropriate name (if none is provided) which
allows for the appropriate callback lookups to be completed by the `EventListener`.

We can now accomplish the same tone play steps from above using the
built-in :ref:`TonePlay <toneplayapp>` app::

    >>> from switchio.apps.players import TonePlay
    >>> client.load_app(TonePlay)
    Feb 25 13:27:43 [INFO] switchio.Client@vm-host api.py:1020 : Loading call app 'TonePlay'
    'fd27be58-bd1b-11e4-b22d-74d02bc595d7'  # the app uuid since None provided

    >>> client.apps.TonePlay
    <switchio.apps.players.TonePlay at 0x7f7c5fdaf650>

    >>> isinstance(client.apps.TonePlay, TonePlay)  # Loading the app type instantiates it
    True

.. note::
    App loading is *atomic* so if you mess up app implementation you don't have
    to worry that inserted callbacks are left registered with the `EventListener`

Assuming the ``switchio`` :ref:`park-only dialplan <parkonly>` is used by the
`external`_ sip profile we can now originate our call again::

    >>> job = client.originate('park@vm-host:5080',
        proxy='intermediary_hostname:5060',
        app_id=client.apps.TonePlay.cid
    )
    >>> job.wait(10)  # wait for call to connect
    >>> call = client.listener.calls[job.sess_uuid]  # look up the call by originating sess uuid
    >>> call.hangup()

Example Snippet
---------------
As a summary, here is an snippet showing all these steps together:

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    from switchio import Client, EventListener
    from switchio.apps.players import TonePlay

    # init
    listener = EventListener('vm-host')
    client = Client('vm-host', listener=listener)
    client.connect()
    listener.connect()
    listener.start()

    # app load
    id = client.load_app(TonePlay)
    # make a call
    job = client.originate(
        dest_url='park@vm-host',
        proxy='intermediary_hostname',
        app_id=id
    )
    sessid = job.get(30)
    assert sessid == job.sess_uuid
    # hangup
    call = client.listener.calls[job.sess_uuid]
    orig_sess = call.sessions[0]  # get the originating session
    time.sleep(10)  # let it play a bit
    orig_sess.hangup()

Conveniently enough, the boilerplate here
is almost exactly what the :py:func:`~switchio.api.get_client`
context manager does internally.  An example of usage can be found in
the :doc:`quickstart <quickstart>` guide.
