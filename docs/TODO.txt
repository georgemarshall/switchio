TODO:
    - Consider tearing down the last N calls when limit is decreased by N?
    - Move all fs looking logging into this package?
    - consider adding a 'register_observer/poller' interface where objects can
      ask to only receive events they care about from the listener?
      (listener might return an itr of callables for each consumer request?)
    - registration of clients for events associated with their id (i.e.
      events not pertaining to that id should trigger invocation of that
      client's callbacks)
    - connections collection so that any registered connections will be
      reconnected on server restart
    - register handlers/callbacks using decorator mechanism

Useful FreeSWITCH debugging commands:

	/events plain CHANNEL_CREATE CHANNEL_ORIGINATE CHANNEL_HANGUP CHANNEL_ANSWER
	SERVER_DISCONNECTED SOCKET_DATA BACKGROUND_JOB

	uuid_dump <session-id>
